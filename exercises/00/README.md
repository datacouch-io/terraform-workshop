# Exercise #0: Your First Terraform Project

###Problem Statement : 

1. Using Terraform, Create a file in this directory named <your_first_name>.txt
2. The file should contain asingle line `Hello, Terraform`
3. Destroy the newly created file using terraform

Take a look at this directory.  You should see a couple of files aside from this README.

```bash
ls -lah
```

You'll see a .tf files:

### main.tf

Though the name of a terraform config file is mostly arbitrary, this is generally the name ascribed 
to the major configuration file within a Terraform working directory.

Inside, you will see the following:

```HCL
# Declare the provider being used, in this case it's AWS.
# This provider supports setting the provider version, AWS credentials as well as the region.
# It can also pull credentials and the region to use from environment variables, which we have set, so we'll use those
terraform {
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "2.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "local" {
  # Configuration options
}

# declare a resource stanza so we can create something.
resource "local_file" "myfile" {
  content = "Hello, Terraform"
  filename = "${path.module}/foo.bar"
}
```

This directory is a very simple example of a terraform project or module.

### Commands

So we have these files that make up our project, now what?  Well, let's try to run some terraform commands against them

````bash
# init is generally the first command you run after writing your config files.  It does
# a few things but a simple way to thing about init: it initializes the working directory to prepare
# it to run plans and applies
terraform init


# On running plan command, terraform performs a refresh(unless explicitly disabled) and then
# determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files
terraform plan


#The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration,
# or the predetermined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan

terraform apply

# The terraform destroy command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve


# Clean up after the demo
rm *.tfstate
rm -rf .terraform
````
